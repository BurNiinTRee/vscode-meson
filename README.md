# Meson for VisualStudio Code

This extension provides support for [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
This is entirely based on the grammar found in the [atom extension](https://github.com/TingPing/language-meson) from [Patrick Griffis](https://github.com/TingPing).

Meson logo by @jpakkane, [licensed for use by this project](http://mesonbuild.com/legal.html).
Icons from the [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) project.

## TODO IMPORTANT: LICENSE WARNING

For faster development, this extension has taken unlicensed icons from other places (namely, `vector-of-bool.cmake`) and uses it here currently. This will be solved before the PR is merged/a new version is released.
